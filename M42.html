<h3>-Introduction</h3>
<P>&nbsp;The heritage of the Praktica cameras is divided between the Zeiss 
      Ikon Contax S, and the KW Praktica. After the war ZEISS IKON was divided 
      between East and West Germany. While West German Zeiss Ikon continued the 
      production of rangefinder Contax cameras, Zeiss Ikon Dresden introduced 
      the first camera with a built-in pentaprism. It used the M42 lens mount, 
      that was being developed by KW for the Praktica.</P>

<P>&nbsp;In 1959 Zeiss 
      Ikon Dresden was merged with four other Dresden camera factories, in the 
      VEB Kamera und Kinowerk Dresden. One of those companies was KW that for 
      years produced some excellent cameras: the Praktisix, the Praktinas and 
      the Prakticas. 
      <H3>-KW/Praktica cameras (until 1959)</H3>
      <P>&nbsp;KW (Kamera-Werkstätten Guthe &amp; Thorsch Dresden) was founded 
      in 1919, in 1937 it was bought by the Charles A. Noble of Detroit USA. In 
      1939 KW introduced the Praktiflex, sharing with the Kine-Exakta the title 
      of being the first 35mm single lens reflex camera. </P>

     <P>&nbsp;As the original Praktica model began ageing, KW developed a top of 
      the line camera the Praktina.<BR>The Praktina was a competitor to the more 
      advanced cameras from Exakta and Pentacon/Zeiss Ikon. It had many 
      accessories like an auto winder and a film back, it was a "scientific" 
      camera opposed to the "amateur" status of the Praktica. Unlike the 
      Praktica it was sold with a Pentaprism.
 It used a bayonet lens mount, 
      this mount prevented the Praktina from being as popular as the Prakticas, 
      as few manufacturers produced lenses to the Praktina. </p>

      <P>&nbsp;In 1959 KW updated their range of Praktica cameras. The Praktica 
      design was becoming old, so KW incorporated a built-in pentaprism, and a 
      winder lever. The Praktica IV was born. But that was not enough, Japanese 
      competition was growing. So in 1959 KW was merged with Zeiss Ikon Dresden, 
      the new company was called Pentacon. </P>

      <h3>Praktica/Pentacon cameras (after 1959)</h3> 
      <P>After the unification of KW and Zeiss Ikon. The East German camera 
      production was reorganized. The Praktina range was progressively 
      phased out. The Praktica range was once again improved. The Pentacon Super would become the top of the line camera. Among the East German camera manufacturers only Exakta 
      continued, for now, independent.

      <P>&nbsp;In 1965 after many years of production, the Praktica design was 
      changed. <BR>A new model, the Praktica Nova (New) appeared, it had 
      features reflecting the heritage of Pentacon. The camera had the 
      traditional Zeiss Ikon Dresden angled shutter release. But it maintained 
      the shutter mechanism of the KW Prakticas, to be replaced in the Praktica 
      mat. <BR>But innovation didn't stop there, at the same time Pentacon 
      launched the Praktica mat, the first European camera with TTL metering. 
      <BR>&nbsp;In 1966, another first, the Praktica Electronic, was the first 
      camera with an electronic controlled shutter.. The design of shutter was 
      very similar to the one used many years later in the Praktica B200. The 
      Praktica electronic never entered production. &nbsp;Overall, the new 
      cameras were smaller, had a better finish and the winder lever was placed 
      in the top of the camera. </P>

      <P>&nbsp;In 1969 the Ihagee Kamerawerk, was being integrated in the 
      Pentacon Kombinat. <BR>Their cameras were too expensive to manufacture, 
      and it was suffering from Japanese competition. <BR>So a camera was 
      jointly developed by Ihagee and Pentacon. It used the efficient 
      manufacturing techniques, which were being developed for the Praktica L 
      series of cameras. The shutter was the one of the Pentacon Super; the lens 
      mount was the traditional Exakta mount. Exakta enthusiasts have a little 
      "disdain", for the Exakta RTL1000 so it must have a space in this page.</P>

      <P>&nbsp;In 1970 the VEB Pentacon, launched the Praktica L. The Praktica L 
      was the first of a line of cameras that were made, until German 
      reunification. The biggest innovation, from previous Praktica cameras, was 
      the excellent vertical focal-plane shutter. The Praktica L shutter was 
      first used in the Pentacon Super and in the Exakta RTL1000. The reason why 
      there are still so many screw mount Prakticas in use is this excellent 
      piece of engineering. </P>

      <P><B>&nbsp;Note:</B> It's almost impossible to make an accurate list of 
      the lenses made in East Germany for Contax S/Pentacon/Praktica cameras. 
      The lenses were upgraded over the years, so you can find the same lens 
      with different finishes. Besides that the lenses were made with different 
      features, such as electric mounts and 2 pin mounts to transfer aperture 
      information to the camera. There were multi coated and non multi coated 
      versions of the same lens. </P>
