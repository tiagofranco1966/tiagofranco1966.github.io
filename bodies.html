    <TD colSpan=7><B>Introduction</B> 
      <P>&nbsp;In 1978 Pentacon presented the first bayonet mount Praktica. 
      After receiving some criticism at the Photokina, the Praktica B200 
      suffered minor modifications and was finally presented to the general 
      public. 
      <P>&nbsp;After German reunification production of Praktica B cameras was mantained, thanks to the huge stock of parts left from Socialist times.
	Production was stopped around 2002 when the stock began to exhaust, and Pentacon no longer had the money, nor the will, to design a new camera.

      <B>B series</B> 
      <P>&nbsp;The Praktica B200 was presented in the 1978 Photokina, but was 
      available to the the general public only in 1980. The first version of 
      both the B200 and B100 had a "grenade" style body covering. Subsequent 
      models had a smooth finish, and an improved winding gear. There was a late 
      version of the B200 finished in silver.<BR>&nbsp; The B200 used a GaAsP 
      meter, the B100 a Cds meter.

      <B>BC series</B> 
      <P>&nbsp;After some delay the BC1 was launched in 1984, it was the first 
      Praktica with flash dedication, it had improved electronics including a 
      new Silicon meter. <BR>&nbsp;An intermediate model was available in the UK 
      market the BCX, it used the new electronics of the BC1 but didn't had 
      flash dedication, it had the same covering of the silver B200.<BR>&nbsp; 
      The Jenaflex cameras were made to commemorate the 50th anniversary, of the 
      first Dresden made mirror-reflex camera.

      <P>&nbsp;In 1988 a new model was launched the BX20, it was the first major 
      redesign of the PB line. A new chassis and electronics were used. For the 
      first time a Praktica had TTL flash metering.<BR>&nbsp;Budget derivatives 
      were produced like the BX10 and BX10 DX, but enjoyed limited distribution, 
      because the BCA/BMS production line was still active.<BR><BR>There were 
      some BX models produced for German mail-order catalogue firms, like the 
      BX200.<BR>During 1990 were produced a small number of BX20 cameras stamped 
      "Made in Germany" instead of the usual "Made in German Democratic 
      Republic".<BR>&nbsp;The BX20s was presented at 1990s Photokina were was 
      announced the closing of the VEB Pentacon.<BR>After German reunification 
      Schneider Dresden was created to continue the production of Praktica 
      cameras.<BR>The BMS and the BCA were produced by Schneider Dresden for a 
      short period. Production is officially stopped, but the Pentacon service department has enough parts, to make a few more cameras.
