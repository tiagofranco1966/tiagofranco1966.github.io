      <H4>The camera</H4>
      <P>The first Praktica B was the Praktica B200 of 1978; it was presented at 
      that year Photokina. Praktica cameras were made in East Germany by VEB 
      Pentacon, one of the more respected European camera manufacturers. The 
      Praktica B200 was the first Praktica with bayonet lens mount. The B200 was 
      a very advanced camera, Japanese camera makers were using either 
      mechanical or hybrid mechanic/electronic lens mounts. The Praktica used 
      full electronic lens coupling. The Praktica B200 provided serious 
      photographers with features that, even today, are difficult to find 
      together in one camera: 
      <UL>
        <LI>Operation without battery. </LI>
        <LI>Provision for mechanical cable release. </LI>
        <LI>Depth of field preview. </LI>

      <P>&nbsp;A new line of lenses, called Prakticar, was produced for this new 
      camera mount. They were made by Carl Zeiss Jena, Pentacon, and Sigma. 
      Later the basic B200 body was improved with the Praktica BC1 that included 
      dedicated flash circuitry. With it's many variations the BC1 was one of 
      the most successful Praktica bayonet models.<BR>&nbsp;In 1988 the Praktica 
      BX20 was launched, it was based in a new chassis, and for the first time a 
      Praktica camera included TTL flash metering. <BR>&nbsp;After German 
      Reunification production was taken by Schneider-Dresden, the production of 
      the Praktica BX20s was initiated. Regular production of Praktica bayonet cameras was 
	stopped around 2002 when the stock of parts, left from Socialist times, begin to exhaust.
	Pentacon continues to service Praktica SLR cameras, my guess is that they still can assemble a few Praktica BX20s with the parts remaining.
	<P>&nbsp;Pentacon doesn't have the money, nor the will, to develop a new SLR camera.  (Pentacon could always contract Cosina to produce a camera with PB lens mount, other manufacturers have done this in order to mantain support for their manual focus lenses. But this will probably never happen).</P>
